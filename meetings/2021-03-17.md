### Discussion

* WAC, WAC(+), and ACP: can they coexist or are they mutually exclusive? (Asked by @elf-pavlik). 
Here is material to help:
   - [Re-using Policies](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/184) brings WAC+ and ACP closer together
   -  Discuss allowing ACLs to be visible, as needed by both WAC+ and ACP:
      + [ACLs on ACLs](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/189)
      + [ACP allows restrictions on ACRs](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/151)
      + [PR 250 in protocol: reduce requirements on `acl:Change` to edit and create](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/250)
