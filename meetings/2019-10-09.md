## Minimal Set of Use Cases
 - Dmitri: Need to be able to identify apps
 - ...: Need to have a class of resources
 - ...: Could have app registry
 - Elf: I think we need to clarify the use cases.

## Tags vs Token Embedding
 - Michael: I don't think that putting scopes and tags inside the token would be a good idea because it constrains us to openid. That doesn't work with TLS.
 - ...: The alternative is apps have tags. You give tags to apps and that could be stored in the server, and you would change them through the privilege request protocol or they could be put in the id token or they could be in your profile.
 - ...: One benefit is you make access change portable and genralized and they can be used as access change policies and could use `rdfs:seeAlso`.
 - Henry extension to ACL that allows you to define who has access to things:

## Propsals
 - It looks like this conversation is getting away from us so we need to reaffirm use cases.

### Identifying Applications
 - All apps/services/anything has a WebID (with the origin or a public key)
 - Apps do not have their own webID but they have an app manifest

## Use Cases
 - https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-change-panel/blob/master/UseCases.md
 - Proposal Problems to be Solved:
     - An app's source should be able to be identified (instance on an app store)
     - A specific instance (single installation) of an app should be able to be identified
     - A specific session of an app should be able to be identified. (in-browser apps only have access to storage on this level, like IndexDB / localStorage)
     - A user should be able to constrain an app to a particular container or resource
     - A resource owner should be able to constrain an app to a particular container or resource
         - This use case is important to Tim
         - Dmitri: I would claim that this is technically not possible. (unlike the previous item)
     - An app should be always able to store app preferences for a specific user
     - An app should be able to request access for its specific resource. (Separate from the user, see next item)
     - A request should be able to be made to request access to a specific resource for some WebID (like in Google Docs, there's the 'Request Access' to this document button, for a particular user)
     - An app should be able to request access to a kind of resource
        - shapes?
        - tags?
        - RDF classes?
        - mime types / file extensions?
    - There should be varying levels of sensitivity around conesenting for access. (This would trigger different UIs to get consent)
         - Michael: Privilege request protocol might help with this
    - An app manifest should be discoverable from an app identifier. (See [W3C App Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/) for example, as well as the [Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata) in OIDC Dynamic Registration). This manifest contains at least info required for a user to make an informed consent decision (includes things like app name, developer, app icon, etc)
